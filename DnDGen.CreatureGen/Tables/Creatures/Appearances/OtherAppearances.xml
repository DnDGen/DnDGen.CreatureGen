    <entry>A towering thing of pulpy flesh and exposed veins, covered in fangs and hooks. Three legs upon which it walks with unsteady and lurching steps. Face is fractured, with bent eyes and nose hooked three times.</entry>
    <entry>A filmy mass of rope-like tentacles with vermilion tips that slither along. Bulbous body ringed by gnashing mouths and topped by a viscous sac holding ten bobbing eyes. Dozens of vestigial wings that flap too feebly to give it flight.</entry>
    <entry>A powerful and muscular beast, armed with claws and alligator jaws.</entry>
    <entry>A graceful six-legged creature with delicate arms and shining skin. Maned head with three flashing eyes. Walks with a smooth gait and noble bearing.</entry>
    <entry>A man-sized creature with stumpy feet - can only shuffle. Hands like crab's claws. Body like dough falling from broken bones. Head is balding and pitted with empty eye sockets.</entry>
    <entry>A slender raptor-like creature with large talons underneath its body and broad wings, all covered with dark fur. Two hateful, coldly-gleaming eyes.</entry>
    <entry>A sac of intestines, warm and wet and steaming. Both deaf and blind. To move, it rolls and flops like limp sausages falling down stairs, becoming looped and draped around all obstacles and lying as a tangled sprawl.</entry>
    <entry>A hollowed-out carcass, swelling with gases into a balloon-like husk, bobbing along in the air with the ends of its body trailing about it and tangling others.</entry>
    <entry>A plump moth with brilliantly colored wings like the stained glass of temples and compound eyes that sparkle like a myriad of jewels.</entry>
    <entry>The person one least suspects.</entry>
    <entry>A writhing mass of teeth and barbed tentacles, grey and rotting. Random clawed hands hide under some of the tentacles.</entry>

    <entry>Broad nasal openings, making its face look like a skull. Segmented horns the curve forward and down, somewhat like a ram's horns, but not as curly. These horns are bone-colored near their bases, but darken to dead black at the tips. One inch of deteriorated flesh around the horns and cheekbones, as though eaten by acid, leaving only thin layers of hide covering the skull. Most teeth protrude when the mouth is closed. Big spikes stud the lower jaw. Small horns jut from the chin, and a row of hornlets crown the head.</entry>

    <entry>Dramatic frilled ears. A single horn atop its short, blunt head. The horn juts forward from a base that takes up most of the top of the head. The horn has two points, with the primary slightly curved and reaching well forward, with the smaller secondary point behind. Rows of hornlets line the brow ridges and run back from the nostrils along the entire length of the head. Short snout with underslung lower jaw. Cluster of bladelike scales under its chin and hornlets on its cheeks. Most teeth protrude when its mouth is closed.</entry>

    <entry>Central body about the size of a large dog, with 10 spindly spider's legs coming out of it. Each of these legs is tipped with a claw. The head is almost exactly the same size as the central body, and resembles a cross between a snake, a vulture and a goblin (some would say it is almost monkey-like). The central body and legs of the Rast are brown, while the head and claws are rust red.</entry>
